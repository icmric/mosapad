# MosaPad: Your Open Source OneNote Alternative

## PLEASE NOTE: Mosapad is still in very early development and is not ready for general use

**MosaPad** is a free and open-source note-taking app inspired by the power and flexibility of Microsoft OneNote. Built with Flutter, MosaPad provides a limitless canvas where you can capture your thoughts, ideas, and to-dos just like you would in a physical notebook, but with the added benefits of digital organization and rich editing.

**Key Features:**

* **Freeform Canvas, OneNote Style:** Just like in OneNote, MosaPad gives you an infinite canvas where you can create notes anywhere. Drag, drop, resize, and arrange them to your heart's content, creating a personalized layout that mirrors your thought process.

* **Rich Text Editing:** Format your notes with bold, italics, lists, headings, and more using the intuitive Quill editor. This gives you the power to structure your notes and highlight key information.

* **Organize with Notebooks and Sections:** MosaPad allows you to create multiple notebooks, each with its own set of sections, mirroring the familiar organizational structure of OneNote.

* **Zoom and Pan:** Navigate large canvases with ease using pinch-to-zoom and panning gestures, ensuring that no matter how many notes you create, you can always find what you need.

* **Cross-Platform Harmony:** Built with Flutter, MosaPad works seamlessly across your devices (desktop, web, mobile), providing a consistent experience wherever you go.

* **Open Source and Collaborative:** MosaPad is a community-driven project. Contribute, customize, and be part of shaping the future of note-taking.

**Planned Future Updates:**

* **Maths Suport:** Write complex equations and symbols like in onenote.

* **Handwriting Support:** Capture your thoughts naturally with stylus input, allowing for handwritten notes and sketches.

* **Collaboration Features:** Work together on notes with others in real-time, enabling seamless teamwork and idea sharing.

* **Cloud Synchronization:** Keep your notes synchronized across all your devices and access them from anywhere.

* **Themes and Customization:** Personalize your MosaPad experience with different themes and color schemes.
